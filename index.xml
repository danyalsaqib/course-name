My supervisor is Dr. Marie Charbonneau.
I previously completed my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Electrical Engineering from the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the National University of Sciences and Technology. My Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s Thesis focused on a self-supervised robotic grasping setup.</description></item><item><title>Privacy policy</title><link>/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/privacy/</guid><description>Links to other websites Other websites referenced here may collect information about you, use cookies, embed additional tracking services from third parties, and record your interaction with that embedded content, including your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are signed in to that website.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/</guid><description>Selected Projects Scalable Self-Supervised Learning for Robotic Grasping

This is my Bachelor’s thesis. We created a scalable robotic setup that automates both the collection of data, dataset labelling, and the training of the Neural Network for grasping. Based on papers published by Alex Krizhevsky and Abhinav Gupta. Unbiased Scene Graph Generation
Danyal Saqib
An implementation of an unbiased scene graph generator using Kaihua Tang’s published papers and github repository as references.</description></item><item><title>Publications</title><link>/publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/</guid><description>Peer reviewed papers MEGA: Malleable Encryption Goes Awry (to appear)

I think teaching is one of the most rewarding activities one can engage in. There is a profound joy in watching someone have an &amp;ldquo;aha&amp;rdquo;-moment and see how things fall into place. I also think it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best ways to learn new things myself. Students&amp;rsquo; questions and muddy points challenge my understanding of the topic I&amp;rsquo;m teaching, and their background knowledge and insights broaden my perspective.</description></item></channel></rss>
