# Selected Projects

1. [**Scalable Self-Supervised Learning for Robotic Grasping**](https://github.com/danyalsaqib/self-supervised-robotic-grasping)  
*Danyal Saqib, Salman Nasir, Obaid-ur-Rahman, Abdul Mohaiman Hashmi*  

This is my Bachelor’s thesis. We created a scalable robotic setup that automates both the collection of data, dataset labelling, and the training of the Neural Network for grasping. Based on papers published by Alex Krizhevsky and Abhinav Gupta.

2. [**Unbiased Scene Graph Generation**](https://github.com/danyalsaqib/SGG_Custom)   
*Danyal Saqib*  

An implementation of an unbiased scene graph generator using Kaihua Tang’s published papers and github repository as references. Some of the work includes addition of windows compatibility, block diagrammatic explanations, and implementation of the SGG as a function on image inputs.


3. [**Machine Learning Basics**](https://github.com/danyalsaqib/Machine-Learning-Basics)  
*Danyal Saqib, Wajahat Hussain*  

Creation of tutorials for Machine Learning Basics, as part of the teaching assistantship at SEECS, NUST. Tutorials include coding lessons for the most commonly used libraries in Machine Learning.


3. [**Systematic Comparison of Neural Network Architectures**](https://github.com/danyalsaqib/Transfer-Learning-with-Data-Augmentation)  

<sm  style="font-size: 0.8em;">
Comparing different CNN Architectures using Transfer Learning. Also compared various data augmentation techniques such as geometric transformations, DCT, and DWT.
