#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a MSc student at the University of Calgary's Mechanical Engineering department, with research focusing on Robotics and Controls. I am a part of the Human-Robot Collaboration lab, supervised by Dr. Marie Charbonneau. My research interests include interactive robotics, compliant control algorithms, and physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). I am currently researching energy-based control methods for safe pHRI.
