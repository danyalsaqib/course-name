I'm an MSc student at the <a href="https://www.ucalgary.ca" target="_blank">University of Calgary</a>'s <a href="https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/mechanical-manufacturing" target="_blank">Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering</a>, where I do research focusing on the development of Compliant Control methods for Human-Robot Interaction, via adaptive control policies and learning algorithms. My supervisor is <a href="https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/marie-charbonneau" target="_blank">Dr. Marie Charbonneau</a>.

I previously completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the <a href="https://seecs.nust.edu.pk" target="_blank">School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS)</a>. at the <a href="https://nust.edu.pk" target="_blank">National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST)</a>, Islamabad, Pakistan. My Bachelor's Thesis focused on a <a href="https://github.com/danyalsaqib/self-supervised-robotic-grasping.git" target="_blank">self-supervised robotic grasping setup</a>. This project was supervised by <a href="https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/muhammad-wajahat-hussain/" target="_blank">Dr. Wajahat Hussain</a>.

In my free time, I do try to go out for walks and try new food (though I often end up in front of my monitor). I find graphics design incredibly therapeutic! My portfolio can be found <a href="https://danyalsaqib.crevado.com/danyal-saqib-portfolio" target="_blank">here</a>.
