I'm a MSc student at the [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca)'s [Department of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/mechanical-manufacturing), where I do research focusing on the development of Compliant Control methods for Human-Robot Interaction, via adaptive control policies and learning algorithms. My supervisor is [Dr. Marie Charbonneau](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/marie-charbonneau).

I previously completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk) at the [National University of Sciences and Technology](https://nust.edu.pk). My Bachelor's Thesis focused on a [self-supervised robotic grasping setup](https://github.com/danyalsaqib/self-supervised-robotic-grasping.git). This project was supervised by [Dr. Wajahat Hussain](https://seecs.nust.edu.pk/faculty/muhammad-wajahat-hussain/).

In my free time, I do try to go out for walks and try new food (though I often end up in front of my monitor). I find graphics design incredibly therapeutic! My portfolio can be found [here](https://danyalsaqib.crevado.com/danyal-saqib-portfolio).
